Welcome! I am a final year master student at School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, majoring in Natural Language Processing. I am supervised by Prof. Junhui Li. My research interest revolves around real-world problems related to natural languages and text information.

I am currently a research intern at Tencent AI Lab. My recent research concentration is primarily on open-domain dialog systems.
